# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning with Python and Jupyter Notebook.
# Overview
This project is a self-initiated deep dive into leveraging machine learning to address a significant health challenge: the early prediction of diabetes. My objective was to move beyond theoretical concepts and build a practical, data-driven solution that provides actionable insights. The process involved meticulous data collection, rigorous analysis, and the implementation of a classification model. A key focus was on data integrity, where I applied specific validation strategies and cleaning techniques to ensure the reliability of the model's output. The resulting model serves as a clear demonstration of how attention to detail and a methodical approach can translate complex data into a tool for effective decision-making in a healthcare context.

# Project Description
In this project, we utilize Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze diabetes data and create predictive models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains features such as:

* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age
* Outcome (1 for diabetes, 0 for non-diabetes)

# Dependencies
	To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

# Model Development
	* Data Collection: Collected medical data including features and target labels from the dataset.
	* Feature Scaling: Standardized the data using StandardScaler for uniformity in model training.
	* Train-Test Split: Divided data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting and ensure model generalization.
	* Model Training: Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more to train the model.
	* Evaluation: Measured model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

# Evaluation
Model evaluation involved:
	* Accuracy
