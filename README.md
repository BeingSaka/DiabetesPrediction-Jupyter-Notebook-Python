# Project Description
In this project, we utilize Python and Jupyter Notebook to analyze diabetes data and create predictive models. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, training machine learning models, and evaluating their performance.

# Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains features such as:

* Pregnancies
* Glucose
* BloodPressure
* SkinThickness
* Insulin
* BMI
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction
* Age
* Outcome (1 for diabetes, 0 for non-diabetes)

# Dependencies
	To run this project, the following Python libraries are required:

* Pandas
* NumPy
* scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Jupyter Notebook

# Model Development
	* Data Collection: Collected medical data including features and target labels from the dataset.
	* Feature Scaling: Standardized the data using StandardScaler for uniformity in model training.
	* Train-Test Split: Divided data into training and testing sets to avoid overfitting and ensure model generalization.
	* Model Training: Applied classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and more to train the model.
	* Evaluation: Measured model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

# Evaluation
Model evaluation involved:
	* Accuracy
	* Precision
	* Recall
	* F1-score
Results from the evaluation suggest a reliable predictive model capable of assisting in diabetes diagnosis.
